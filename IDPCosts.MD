## Volume-Based Scenarios

### Document Complexity Impact

#### Simple Documents (1-2 pages, minimal extraction)
- 30-40% reduction in Bedrock costs
- 50% reduction in Lambda duration
- Overall savings: ~25-30%

#### Complex Documents (20+ pages, multiple extractions)
- 2-3x increase in token usage
- Longer Lambda execution times
- Overall cost increase: ~150-200%

#### With Assessment Feature Enabled
- Additional Bedrock calls for confidence scoring
- ~20-30% increase in overall Bedrock costs
- Provides quality assurance and HITL triggers

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Model Selection
- **Development/Testing**: Use Claude 3 Haiku
- **Production**: Balance accuracy needs vs. cost
- **Critical Documents**: Consider Claude 3.5 Sonnet selectively

### 2. Caching Strategies
- Cache OCR results for re-processing
- Store classification results for similar documents
- Implement prompt caching for repeated patterns

### 3. Batch Processing
- Process during off-peak hours
- Aggregate small documents
- Use larger Lambda memory for faster execution (sometimes cheaper)

### 4. Storage Optimization
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost optimization
- Lifecycle policies for old documents
- Compress extracted JSON results

### 5. Reserved Capacity
- Lambda Reserved Concurrency for predictable workloads
- Consider Savings Plans for consistent usage
- Negotiate Enterprise Agreements for high volumes

## The Classification Paradox

### The Challenge
Implementing a tiered processing strategy (simple vs. complex documents) requires pre-classification, which itself incurs costs.

### Attempted Solutions and Trade-offs

#### 1. Metadata-Based Routing
**Approach**: Use document source/channel as complexity proxy
- ✅ No additional processing costs
- ❌ Assumes uniform complexity by source
- ❌ Misclassification leads to failed extractions

#### 2. File Characteristic Heuristics
**Approach**: Use file size, page count, PDF metadata
- ✅ Minimal computational cost
- ❌ Unreliable (many exceptions)
- ❌ High misclassification rate

#### 3. Sampling Strategy
**Approach**: Process first page to determine complexity
- ✅ More accurate than heuristics
- ❌ Still requires OCR costs
- ❌ May misclassify based on first page

#### 4. Progressive Enhancement
**Approach**: Start cheap, upgrade if confidence low
- ✅ Ensures quality results
- ❌ Potential double-processing costs
- ❌ Increased latency

### Recommendation
For most organizations, a uniform processing pipeline is more practical:
- Predictable costs
- Simpler operations
- Lower failure rates
- Better overall TCO

## ROI Considerations

### Manual Processing Baseline
- Average manual processing: 5-10 minutes per document
- Cost per document (at $30/hour): $2.50-$5.00
- Error rate: 5-10%

### Automated Processing with Pattern 2
- Cost per document (1,000 pages): $0.06
- Processing time: 30-60 seconds
- Error rate: 1-3%

### ROI Calculation Example (10,000 documents/month)
- Manual cost: 10,000 × $3.75 = $37,500
- Automated cost: $610
- Monthly savings: $36,890
- **ROI: 6,047%**

## Cost Monitoring Best Practices

1. **Set up AWS Cost Anomaly Detection**
   - Alert on unusual spending patterns
   - Track per-service costs

2. **Implement CloudWatch Dashboards**
   - Monitor token usage trends
   - Track processing volumes
   - Identify optimization opportunities

3. **Regular Cost Reviews**
   - Monthly analysis of cost trends
   - Quarterly optimization reviews
   - Annual contract negotiations

4. **Tag Resources Appropriately**
   - Environment (dev/test/prod)
   - Document type
   - Business unit

## Conclusion

Pattern 2 provides excellent value for document processing at scale:
- **Small businesses** (1,000 docs/month): ~$60/month
- **Medium businesses** (10,000 docs/month): ~$610/month
- **Enterprises** (100,000 docs/month): ~$5,585/month

The key to cost optimization is:
1. Choose the right model for your accuracy requirements
2. Implement smart caching and storage strategies
3. Monitor and optimize continuously
4. Focus on ROI rather than absolute costs

Even at the highest volumes, the automated solution typically costs less than 2% of manual processing while delivering faster, more accurate results.
